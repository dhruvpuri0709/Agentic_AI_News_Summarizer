# 🤖 Agentic AI Chatbot

> **The future of AI is not just responding—it's *thinking, searching, and acting* autonomously.**

Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in how we interact with artificial intelligence. Rather than simple request-response patterns, agents can plan, use tools, and execute complex workflows. This chatbot harnesses that power through LangGraph and Groq, creating an intelligent system that doesn't just answer—it *reasons*.
